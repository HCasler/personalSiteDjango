    <!-- what is Mu2e -->
    <div class="contentSection">
        <h3>My thesis research was part of a larger experiment called <a href=https://mu2e.fnal.gov>Mu2e.</a></h3>
        <p>The name Mu2e refers to muon-to-electron conversion, an extremely rare physics interaction that has never been observed. A <b>muon</b> is a particle similar to an electron, but much heavier &mdash; over 200 times heavier! Normally, when muons decay, they produce electrons and <b>neutrinos</b> &mdash; tiny particles with very low mass and no electric charge. Muon-to-electron <i>conversion</i> refers to an interaction that produces no neutrinos.</p>
        <p>This type of interaction is forbidden by the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model>Standard Model of particle physics</a>. However, physicists know the Standard Model is incomplete. For instance, the Standard Model predicts that neutrinos should have no mass at all, but experiments at <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ex/9807003>Super-Kamiokande</a> and <a href=https://arxiv.org/abs/nucl-ex/0106015>Sudbury Neutrino Observatory</a> show that neutrinos do have mass, it's just very small. And as it turns out, the mass (or lack thereof) of the neutrinos is a major part of the chain of logic that forbids muon-to-electron conversion in the Standard Model. Since we already know part of this chain of logic is wrong, muon-to-electron conversion is a logical place to look for new physics.</p>
        <p>The Mu2e experiment can be divided into three parts: the Production Solenoid where it makes the muons for the experiment, the Transport Solenoid which selects the right muons (negative electric charge, not moving too fast) and guides them into the Detector Solenoid, and the Detector Solenoid, which contains the target for the muons to stop in, and the detectors that will tell the researchers if a conversion event has occurred. Because Mu2e is looking for an extremely rare event, it needs to stop a lot of muons in the Detector Solenoid, so it needs to create a huge number of muons via the Production Solenoid. </p>

    <!-- why proton beam alignment -->
    <div class="contentSection">
        <h3>My work largely focused on developing a system to align the proton beam with the production target.</h3>
        <p>The Production Solenoid contains the production target: a long, narrow target made of tungsten. Mu2e will take a proton beam from the Fermilab Accelerator and strike this target right down the middle. Because tungsten is a dense material, this will result in many proton-proton and proton-neutron interactions, which will produce particles called pions (as well as many other particles we won't be using). These pions will then decay to muons. Those muons will be guided by the Production Solenoid's magnetic field into the Transport Solenoid.</p>
        <p>In order for this system to work, the proton beam needs to hit the production target right in the center. Simulations have shown that as the beam drifts off-center, the number of muons that reach the Detector Solenoid decreases, even if the beam still hits the target. However, setting up instrumentation around the production target would be extremely challenging. The environment inside the Production Solenoid is harsh, with high levels of heat and radiation and a strong magnetic field. Putting additional objects inside the Production Solenoid also risks absorbing some of the pions that would otherwise decay to useable muons. Instead, we decided to place detectors outside the Production Solenoid, past the production target, where they could detect any parts of the beam that passed through or missed the target.</p>

    <!-- the physical detectors -->
    <div class="contentSection">
        <h3>I chose a model of detector, studied it in action, and built my own.</h3>
        <p>The type of detector to be used is a proportional wire chamber, or <b>PWC.</b> PWC's are made of planes of wires that detect nearby electric charges, inside a gas that amplifies the charges as they approach the wires, with the whole thing under an electric field that guides electrons toward the wires. As protons from the beam pass through the gas, they ionize the gas atoms, freeing electrons to approach the wires. Those electrons are sped up by the electric field until they have enough energy to cause more ionization, and free more electrons to approach the wires, in an effect known as a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Townsend_discharge>Townsend avalanche</a>. The more protons pass through, the more electrons drift to the wires, so that the signals produced by all the wires together give you a picture of the beam intensity distribution. PWC's are commonly used in particle accelerator facilities to ensure the beams have the desired shapes and positions.</p>
        <p>After a series of preliminary simulations, in which I modeled the detector as a flat square that reported everything that hit it, I came to a lucky conclusion: there is a type of PWC made at Fermilab that already fits my requirements. It's big enough that if placed in the right spot, the Mu2e proton beam can't possibly miss it, even if steered way off course. The sense wires are close enough together to give enough details about the beam shape to know if we're off-center, grazing the target, or totally missing it. Its range of sensitivity covers all the possible beam intensities needed, from low-intensity startup to full power.</p>
        <p>Once I had a detector design, it was time to build it. I traveled to Fermilab to work with the people who typically make these detectors. Every one is built "by hand" with essentially no automation. Once I had built them, and built a set of readout electronics, I hooked them up to a power supply for an end-to-end test. I was able to verify that they worked, and was able to verify that I could increase or decrease the sensitivity by increasing or decreasing the voltage on the power supply. The detectors were then placed in the Mu2e beamline, though not in their expected final location behind the production target. Instead, they were placed in front of the diagnostic absorber, the end of a small branch off the Mu2e beamline that allows the Accelerator Department to test the beam before the experiment is completely built. Originally, I planned to do further studies on the function of the detectors at this location, but unfortunately the COVID-19 pandemic got in the way, and things were not fully set up in time. The detectors did prove useful later, however: when the proton beam was first transported all the way to the diagnostic absorber, my detectors gave the first evidence of success.</p>
        <p>Since I couldn't test my new detectors in action, my next best option was to remotely study another detector of the same model. These PWC's are used in many parts of the accelerator at Fermilab, and there was one in a very convenient spot: right at the end of an abort line where excess beam is dumped out of a ring. I designed a study in which the bias voltage, which controls the sensitivity, was increased linearly, and a large number of beam profiles was taken at every bias voltage value. I found that the total signal size was an exponential function of the bias voltage, which was expected. What was interesting, however, was figuring out exactly what that exponential relationship meant.</p>
        <p>While the basics of how these detectors work is well-understood, there isn't a complete theoretical description of exactly how many total free electrons you get per incident particle, at different bias voltages, gas densities, etc. There are a number of different mathematical models that roughly fit the data for different situations; for example, one model may only work at very low gas density, while another may only work up to a certain value of the electric field. Based on the data I collected, I selected a candidate model that describes the signal size from the PWC at various bias voltages. This candidate model can be used to estimate the right bias voltage to use for the detectors in the experiment. It can also be used to estimate the threshold voltage &mdash; that is, the voltage below which the detector doesn't work. It's important to keep our working bias voltage well above the threshold, to avoid unexpected effects.</p>

    <!-- the scanning procedure -->
    <div class="contentSection">
        <h3>I developed an alignment procedure after many rounds of simulations.</h3>
        <p>The main problem I had to solve was as follows: once the beam, target, and detectors are all in place, how can we scan the beam across the target and read the detector signals in such a way as to find the correct beam position? The beam can be moved left, right, up, and down, and can also be angled slightly in those directions. That's four degrees of freedom; mapping all possible combinations of position and angle to a unique detector signal would take far loo long for Mu2e's needs. My goal, then, wass to create a procedure that would disentagle these degrees of freedom somewhat.</p>
        <p>In order to create my procedure, I had to make a model of the detector in C++ and add it to the larger simulation of the Mu2e experiment as a whole. Once I determined the level of detail my model needed and had it coded up, it was time to get to work. There were a number of different situations I needed to consider when performing these simulations. For example, one of the first ones I did simulated sweeping the proton beam vertically across the front of the target, and looking at how much of the beam made it past the target and into my detectors. I found something interesting: we already knew the beam does not travel in a straight line through the target, but curves upward. It turns out this upward curve is noticeable enough that the relationship between beam position at the target and beam intensity on the detectors is not even close to symmetrical. This proved to be useful, as it meant the results of grazing the beam along one edge in particular were extremely sensitive to changes in the beam's angle.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, the alignment procedure I came up with can be divided into discrete phases: one for initial rough alignment, one for vertical angle and position alignment, and one for horizontal angle and position alignment.</p>
